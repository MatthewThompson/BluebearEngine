BluebearEngine is a chess engine I wrote with inspiration
taken from the open source engine Stockfish 6.

Most of the types, and simple functions for the board and
position representation were taken from Stockfish, all the
evaluation and search amongst other things were written
myself.

This engine is a work in progress, to do list(in order of priority):
 - Move string methods to a util header.
 - Other code cleaning and commenting.
 - Make the search better than just brute force.
 - Improve the evaluation function.
 - Multithread it.
 - Add draw by repetition rule.
 - Learn how to make 64 bit executables...
 - Do the makefile.
